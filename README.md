# Amazon-Fake-Review-Detector

One of the submissiosn for the 2023 Data Hack at UT Austin.

An algorithm that attempts to distinguish fake reviews (be it AI or human generated) in Amazon products using the following features:

    reviewerID      - A unique identifier for the reviewer. This is a string that represents a specific person who wrote the review.
    asin            - A unique identifier for the product being reviewed.
    reviewerName    - The display name of the reviewer. This is a string containing the name that the reviewer chose to display publicly on their Amazon account.
    helpful         - An array of two integers representing the helpfulness of the review. The first integer is the number of helpful votes the reviewreceived, and the                         second integer is the total number of votes (helpful and unhelpful) the review received.
    reviewText      - The main text of the review. This is a string containing the full text that the reviewer wrote to describe their experience with the product.
    overall         - The overall rating of the product given by the reviewer. This is a float value ranging from 1.0 to 5.0, with 1.0 being the lowest rating and 5.0                           being the highest rating.
    summary         - A brief summary of the review. This is a string containing a short title or description that summarizes the reviewer's opinion about the product.
    unixReviewTime  - The time when the review was written, represented as a Unix timestamp (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970). This is an integer value.
    reviewTime      - The time when the review was written, represented as a string in the format "MM DD, YYYY" (e.g., "01 30, 2014"). This is a more human-readable                             representation of the review time compared to the Unix timestamp.
    llm             - Whether this sample was generated by GPT-3 (as opposed to part of the original dataset).
    
This algorithm utilizes natural language processing, sentimental analysis, and a Bi-LSTM neural network to predict whether or not it is a fake review.
